  HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of contentâ€”using, for example, fonts or colors.

<p>
  <em>Elements</em>  are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page.
  The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element creates what is known as a <strong>tag</strong>
  . Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags
  <em>Attributes </em> are properties used to provide additional information about an element. The most common attributes include the id attribute, which identifies an element; the class attribute, which classifies an element; the src attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable content; and the href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource
</p>

<p>
  The content inside the <strong>head</strong>  element is not displayed on the web page itself. Instead, it may include the document title (which is displayed on the title bar in the browser window), links to any external files, or any other beneficial metadata.

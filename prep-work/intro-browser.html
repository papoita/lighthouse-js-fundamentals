  HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of content—using, for example, fonts or colors.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Elements</em>  are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page.
  The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element creates what is known as a <strong>tag</strong>
  . Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags
  <em>Attributes </em> are properties used to provide additional information about an element. The most common attributes include the id attribute, which identifies an element; the class attribute, which classifies an element; the src attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable content; and the href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource
</p>

<p>
  The content inside the <strong>head</strong>  element is not displayed on the web page itself. Instead, it may include the document title (which is displayed on the title bar in the browser window), links to any external files, or any other beneficial metadata.

  <em>selectors</em>
  A selector designates exactly which element or elements within our HTML to target and apply styles (such as color, size, and position) to. Selectors may include a combination of different qualifiers to select unique elements, all depending on how specific we wish to be.
</p>
<p>
 <em>Properties</em>
Once an element is selected, a property determines the styles that will be applied to that element. Property names fall after a selector, within the curly brackets, {}, and immediately preceding a colon, :. There are numerous properties we can use, such as background, color, font-size, height, and width
</p>

<p>
 <em>Values</em>
So far we’ve selected an element with a selector and determined what style we’d like to apply with a property. Now we can determine the behavior of that property with a value. Values can be identified as the text between the colon, :, and semicolon, ;. Here we are selecting all <p> elements and setting the value of the color property to be orange and the value of the font-size property to be 16 pixels
</p>
<h3>
  type, class, and ID selectors.
</h3>
<p>
  Type selectors target elements by their element type. For example, should we wish to target all division elements, div {}
</p>
<p>
  Class selectors allow us to select an element based on the element’s class attribute value. Class selectors are a little more specific than type selectors, as they select a particular group of elements rather than all elements of one type. .awesome { ... }
  div class="awesome">.../div
</p>
<p>
  ID selectors are even more precise than class selectors, as they target only one unique element at a time. Just as class selectors use an element’s class attribute value as the selector, ID selectors use an element’s id attribute value as a selector.#shayhowe { ... }

   div id="shayhowe">.../div

  css resets
  CSS resets take every common HTML element with a predefined style and provide one unified style for all browsers. These resets generally involve removing any sizing, margins, paddings, or additional styles and toning these values down. Because CSS cascades from top to bottom—more on that soon—our reset needs to be at the very top of our style sheet

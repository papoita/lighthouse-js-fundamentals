  getting to know html
</h1>
  <p> Semantics within HTML is the practice of giving content on the page meaning and structure by using the proper element. Semantic code describes the value of content on a page, regardless of the style or appearance of that content.
    </p>
    <p>
      divs, and spans are HTML elements that act as containers solely for styling purposes
    </p>
    <p>
      Block-level elements begin on a new line, stacking one on top of the other, and occupy any available width. Block-level elements may be nested inside one another and may wrap inline-level elements.

    </p>
    <p>
      Inline-level elements do not begin on a new line. They fall into the normal flow of a document, lining up one after the other, and only maintain the width of their content. Inline-level elements may be nested inside one another; however, they cannot wrap block-level elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML comments start with < !-- and end with -- >. CSS comments start with /* and end with */.
    </p>
    <p>
       HTML5 introduced new structurally based elements, including the < header>, < nav>, < article>, < section>, < aside>, and < footer> elements.
    </p>

      Article
The article element is used to identify a section of independent, self-contained content that may be independently distributed or reused. Weâ€™ll often use the article element to mark up blog posts, newspaper articles, user-submitted content, and the like.

 If the content within the article element were removed from the context of the page and placed, for example, within an email or printed work, that content should still make sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the content adds to the document outline and it can be independently redistributed or syndicated, use the article element.

If the content adds to the document outline and represents a thematic group of content, use the section element.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aside> element holds content, such as sidebars, inserts, or brief explanations, that is tangentially related to the content surrounding it. When used within an article> element, for example, the aside> element may identify content related to the author of the article.
